# AI Collaboration Improvements

This extension enhances the AI-Collab system to better handle multiple AI models, particularly when running all 6 models simultaneously. The improvements focus on these key areas:

## 1. Parallel Processing

The original implementation processes critiques and voting phases sequentially, causing timeouts when running with many models. The improved version:

- Uses Promise.all and parallel processing for all collaboration phases
- Replaces sequential for-loops with parallel Promise operations
- Implements proper task scheduling to maximize throughput

## 2. Model-Specific Timeouts

Different AI models have different performance characteristics and response times:

- Creates individual AbortControllers for each model instead of one shared controller
- Adjusts timeout settings based on model complexity (longer for larger models)
- Prevents faster models from being aborted due to slower models' timeouts

## 3. Resource Management

To prevent system overload:

- Adds a throttling mechanism to limit concurrent API requests
- Implements a dynamic scaling system that adjusts concurrency based on available resources
- Prioritizes critical collaboration phases to ensure completion

## 4. Graceful Fallbacks

Enhances error handling to provide meaningful results even when some models fail:

- Recovers gracefully from individual model failures
- Implements partial results processing to continue collaboration when models time out
- Provides meaningful fallbacks at each collaboration phase

## 5. Client Compatibility and Validation

Latest improvements focus on ensuring AI clients are properly validated and connected:

- Adds robust client validation to detect missing or misconfigured AI clients
- Creates a proper mapping between agent names and client objects
- Implements method compatibility layers that adapt between different client APIs
- Provides detailed logging for client availability and method structure
- Adds fallback mechanisms when client validation fails

## 6. Method Compatibility

Adds compatibility between different API client methods:

- Automatically creates wrapper methods when needed (e.g., generate → getResponse)
- Validates both OpenAI-style, Claude-style, and Gemini-style APIs
- Adds detailed client structure inspection to identify API mismatches
- Improves error messages with comprehensive client status information

## Installation

Run the installation script from the project root:

```bash
node install-collab-improvements.mjs
```

This will:
1. Create a backup of the original collaboration.mjs
2. Add the enhanced parallel implementation
3. Seamlessly integrate with existing code

## Usage

The improvements automatically activate when:
- Using more than 3 AI models
- Explicitly enabling via the `useEnhancedCollab: true` option

When running with 3 or fewer models, the system falls back to the original implementation to maintain compatibility.

### UI Toggle for Enhanced Collaboration

A new "Enhanced" toggle has been added to the collaboration controls in the UI, allowing users to explicitly enable the enhanced collaboration algorithm even when using fewer than 4 models. This toggle appears next to the collaboration style dropdown when any collaborative mode is selected.

When enabled:
- The enhanced parallel processing implementation is used
- Individual model timeouts are applied
- Concurrency management is enabled
- The system is more resilient to individual model failures

This is particularly useful for:
- Testing the enhanced implementation with a small set of models
- Using enhanced performance features with your favorite 2-3 models
- Ensuring reliable results in time-sensitive situations

## Testing

To verify the improvements:

```javascript
// In your code
const result = await runCollab({
  prompt: "Your prompt here",
  agentNames: ["claude", "gemini", "chatgpt", "grok", "deepseek", "llama"],
  useEnhancedCollab: true,  // Force enhanced version even with fewer models
  // Other options...
});
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter errors with AI clients in collaboration:

1. Check that API keys are properly set in your .env file
2. Look for these log messages that indicate client issues:
   - `❌ CRITICAL ERROR: clients object is empty or not an object`
   - `❌ Client for ${agent} is not available!`
   - `❌ All agents failed to provide drafts in the Round Table collaboration!`

3. Additional diagnostics have been added that automatically print detailed client availability information when errors occur.

4. If specific models fail, the system will now display which client methods are available and provide better error messages for debugging.

## Reverting Changes

To restore the original implementation:

```bash
cp src/lib/ai/collaboration.original.mjs src/lib/ai/collaboration.mjs
```
