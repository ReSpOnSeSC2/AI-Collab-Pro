# Synthesis Phase Fix

## Changes Made to Fix Synthesis Phase

1. Updated Gemini's max output tokens to the exact limit (65,536 tokens) in `gemini.mjs`

2. Increased safe character limit for synthesis content from 30K to 100K, leveraging Gemini's 1M token context window while still maintaining stability

3. Retained smart content truncation logic that preserves beginning and end portions of each model's response when needed

4. Added detailed logging of content sizes before and after truncation to help diagnose any future issues

These changes allow the AI Collaboration system to utilize Gemini's full capabilities while preventing the AbortError failures that were occurring during the synthesis phase with large responses.
