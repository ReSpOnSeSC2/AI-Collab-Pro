# Context Management Implementation

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the context management feature implementation for the AI-Collab hub. The context management system enables persistent conversation history across multiple messages, with support for different context modes and MongoDB storage.

## Implementation Details

The following components have been implemented:

### 1. Server-Side Components

#### Models
- **Conversation.mjs**: MongoDB schema for storing conversation history
  - Includes document structure with messages, responses, and context metadata
  - Pre-save hook to calculate context size

#### Services
- **conversationService.mjs**: Service layer for MongoDB interactions
  - Implements CRUD operations for conversation contexts
  - Contains logic for generating summaries and managing context size

#### Context Manager
- **contextManager.mjs**: Abstraction layer between application and database service
  - Defines context modes: none, summary, full
  - Provides methods for context operations used by WebSocket handlers

#### API Routes
- **context.mjs**: REST API endpoints for context management
  - Updated to use async/await for all MongoDB operations

#### WebSocket Integration
- **wsHandler.mjs**: Updated to handle context-related WebSocket messages
  - Added handlers for context-related operations

### 2. Client-Side Components

#### Context UI Manager
- **contextManager.js**: Client-side context management UI
  - Toggle switch for quickly enabling/disabling context
  - Interface for switching between context modes
  - Handlers for WebSocket context events

#### CSS Styling
- **context-manager.css**: Styling for context management UI elements

#### Main App Integration
- **main.js**: Integration with the main application flow
  - Added message handling for context-related WebSocket messages

### 3. Testing and Documentation

#### Test Script
- **test-context.mjs**: Test script for context management functionality
  - Tests all core functions of the context management system

#### Documentation
- **context-management.md**: Comprehensive documentation of the feature
  - Includes features, implementation details, and usage instructions

## Context Modes

Three context modes have been implemented:

1. **None** (default): Each message is treated independently
2. **Summary**: A condensed summary of the conversation history is maintained
3. **Full**: Complete conversation history is retained and sent with each prompt

## MongoDB Integration

- The system uses MongoDB for persistent storage of conversation contexts
- Graceful fallback when MongoDB is not available
- Automatic context size calculation and management

## WebSocket Protocol

Added support for these WebSocket message types:

- `context_status`: Get current context status
- `reset_context`: Reset the conversation
- `trim_context`: Trim the context to reduce size
- `set_max_context_size`: Set a custom maximum context size
- `set_context_mode`: Change the context mode (none, summary, full)
- `context_warning`: Warning when context is nearing its limit

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements for the context management system:

1. **AI-Powered Summarization**: Use AI models to generate better summaries of the conversation
2. **Semantic Context Trimming**: Remove less relevant messages instead of just the oldest ones
3. **Hierarchical Context**: Maintain multiple levels of context detail
4. **Context Search**: Allow searching through conversation history
5. **Context Export/Import**: Save and load conversation contexts

## Prerequisites

To use the context management system, the following prerequisites must be met:

- **MongoDB**: A MongoDB instance must be available and configured in the `.env` file
- **Mongoose**: The `mongoose` NPM package is required for MongoDB integration

If MongoDB is not available, the context management system will fail gracefully, allowing the AI-Collab hub to continue functioning without persistent context.
