# Collaboration Modes

This document provides detailed information about the different collaboration modes available in the AI Collaboration Hub and how they function.

## Overview

The AI Collaboration Hub enables multiple LLMs to work together on a single prompt, following different collaboration patterns. Each mode represents a distinct collaboration strategy designed to optimize for different goals:

| Mode | Primary Goal | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Round Table | Consensus | General queries, balanced viewpoints |
| Sequential Critique Chain | Refinement | Factual analysis, incremental improvement |
| Validated Consensus | Accuracy | Research questions, reducing hallucinations |
| Creative Brainstorm Swarm | Creativity | Ideation, novel solutions, creative writing |
| Hybrid Guarded Braintrust | Balanced innovation | Practical innovation requiring factual grounding |

## Detailed Mode Descriptions

### Round Table (Default)

A classic synchronous consensus-building approach where all agents participate equally.

**Process:**
1. All agents draft independent initial answers
2. Agents critique each other's drafts
3. Agents vote on the best elements from different drafts
4. A lead agent merges the insights into a consolidated answer
5. The final answer with rationale is presented to the user

**Example Scenario:**
A user asks about the impacts of climate change on agriculture. Each agent (Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, etc.) gives their initial perspective, then they critique each other's analyses to identify strengths and weaknesses. They then vote on the most valuable insights, and a designated agent consolidates these into a comprehensive answer addressing multiple aspects of the issue.

**Best For:**
- General knowledge questions
- Multi-faceted topics benefiting from diverse perspectives
- Questions requiring balanced viewpoints

**Limitations:**
- Can be computationally expensive with many agents
- May produce "averaged" answers that lose nuance
- Time-consuming with complex topics

### Sequential Critique Chain

A pipeline approach where each agent builds upon and refines the work of the previous agent.

**Process:**
1. First agent generates an initial answer
2. Second agent critiques and amends the first answer
3. Third agent further refines based on both previous contributions
4. Process continues down the chain
5. Final agent or summarizer produces a refined answer

**Example Scenario:**
The user asks for an explanation of quantum entanglement. Claude gives an initial explanation, then Gemini reviews it and adds missing technical details, ChatGPT then reorganizes the information for better clarity, and finally DeepSeek synthesizes everything into a coherent, accurate explanation.

**Best For:**
- Technical explanations requiring progressive refinement
- Content that benefits from multiple editorial passes
- Situations where different models have complementary strengths

**Limitations:**
- Early mistakes can propagate through the chain
- Later agents have disproportionate influence on the final output
- Sequential nature increases total response time

### Validated Consensus

A workflow focused on maximizing factual accuracy and minimizing hallucinations.

**Process:**
1. Two agents co-draft an initial answer
2. Remaining agents act as verifiers/fact-checkers
3. Verifiers flag potentially inaccurate claims
4. If issues are identified, the drafting agents rewrite problematic sections
5. Final answer includes confidence indicators for claims

**Example Scenario:**
The user asks about recent developments in fusion energy. Claude and Gemini draft an initial response covering recent breakthroughs. ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Grok review this draft, flagging any claims that seem speculative or incorrectly dated. The drafting agents then revise these sections, and the final answer includes citations or uncertainty indicators where appropriate.

**Best For:**
- Scientific or technical queries requiring high accuracy
- Fact-heavy responses where hallucinations would be problematic
- Research-oriented questions

**Limitations:**
- More complex to implement
- Higher computational and token cost
- May produce overly cautious responses

### Creative Brainstorm Swarm

A mode optimized for generating novel ideas and creative solutions.

**Process:**
1. **Phase A – Solo Ideation:** Each agent independently generates novel concepts
2. **Phase B – Idea Fusion:** Agents merge distinct ideas into new "mega-ideas"
3. **Phase C – Vote & Amplify:** Agents vote on the most promising mega-idea
4. All agents collaboratively develop the winning idea

**Example Scenario:**
The user asks for innovative solutions to urban waste management. Each agent proposes several unique approaches. The agents then combine ideas (e.g., IoT-enabled waste bins with gamification elements) into more complex concepts. After voting on the most promising hybrid idea, all agents work together to develop it into a detailed proposal.

**Best For:**
- Innovation challenges and ideation
- Creative writing and storytelling
- Product design and brainstorming
- Out-of-the-box problem solving

**Limitations:**
- Limited fact-checking
- May produce impractical or overly theoretical solutions
- Higher variance in quality

### Hybrid Guarded Braintrust

A balanced approach that promotes creativity while maintaining factual accuracy.

**Process:**
1. **Turn 1 – Creative Ideation:** Generates diverse raw ideas (similar to Brainstorm Swarm)
2. **Turn 2 – Validation Sweep:** Top ideas undergo fact-checking and validation
3. **Turn 3 – Rank & Elaborate:** Validated ideas are ranked and the best is developed

**Example Scenario:**
The user asks for novel approaches to teaching mathematics to children. Agents first generate creative ideas like gamified AR math environments, embodied learning techniques, etc. These ideas are then validated for feasibility and educational soundness. The highest-ranked valid idea is then developed into a detailed implementation plan with evidence-based justifications.

**Best For:**
- Practical innovation requirements
- Design thinking exercises
- Educational content creation
- Business strategy development

**Limitations:**
- Most complex workflow
- Highest computational cost
- Requires carefully balanced prompting

## Implementation Considerations

### Agent Selection

For optimal results with each mode:

- **Round Table:** Works best with 3-6 diverse agents
- **Sequential Chain:** Effective with 2-4 agents with complementary strengths
- **Validated Consensus:** Requires at least 3 agents (2 drafters + 1 validator)
- **Creative Brainstorm:** Most effective with 3+ agents with diverse capabilities
- **Hybrid Braintrust:** Requires at least 4 agents for full functionality

### Technical Requirements

Each mode has different computational needs:

| Mode | Token Usage | Parallelization | Response Time |
|------|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| Round Table | High | High | Medium |
| Sequential Chain | Medium | Low | High |
| Validated Consensus | Very High | Medium | High |
| Creative Brainstorm | High | High | Medium |
| Hybrid Braintrust | Very High | Medium | Very High |

### Cost Considerations

For cost-sensitive applications:

- **Round Table:** Can be made more economical by limiting the number of agents
- **Sequential Chain:** Good balance of quality and cost
- **Validated Consensus:** Most expensive due to multiple verification passes
- **Creative Brainstorm:** Variable cost depending on the number of ideas generated
- **Hybrid Braintrust:** Highest overall cost due to complex workflow

## User Interface Guidelines

The UI for each mode should highlight the relevant stages:

- **Round Table:** Show all agents simultaneously with voting indicators
- **Sequential Chain:** Emphasize the progression of refinement
- **Validated Consensus:** Highlight fact-checking processes and confidence levels
- **Creative Brainstorm:** Visualize idea generation and combination
- **Hybrid Braintrust:** Show the transition from creative to analytical phases

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements to the collaboration modes:

- **Customizable Parameters:** Allow users to adjust specific behaviors within each mode
- **Agent Specialization:** Assign specific roles to agents based on their strengths
- **Hybrid Modes:** Create user-definable combinations of existing modes
- **Real-time Intervention:** Allow users to guide the collaboration process midstream
- **Persistent Learning:** Save successful collaboration patterns for future use
