## Setup (0:00 - 5:00)

### Introduction (0:00 - 1:00)

*[Start the video with your webcam visible and a blank terminal]*

"Hello and welcome to this demonstration of the AI Collaboration Hub! I'm [Your Name], and today I'll be showing you how our platform enables multiple AI models to collaborate in solving complex problems. Unlike traditional approaches where you might query different AI models separately and manually compare results, our platform orchestrates a true collaboration between models like Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, and others."

### Environment Setup (1:00 - 3:00)

*[Switch to terminal view]*

"Let's start by setting up our environment. I've already installed Node.js version 18 and npm. First, I'll clone the AI Collaboration Hub repository:"

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ai-collab/ai-collaboration-hub.git
cd ai-collaboration-hub
```

*[Expected output]:*
```

Resolving deltas: 100% (713/713), done.
```

"Now I'll install the dependencies:"

```bash
npm install
```

*[Expected output - truncated]:*
```
added 1287 packages, and audited 1288 packages in 15s
found 0 vulnerabilities
```

### Configuration (3:00 - 5:00)

"Next, I need to configure my environment variables with API keys for the different AI providers. I'll create a `.env` file using the provided template:"

```bash
cp .env.example .env
nano .env  # or your preferred editor
```

*[Show editing the .env file, blurring out actual API keys]:*

```
PORT=3001
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/ai-collab
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# API Keys for AI providers
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-xxxx...  # Claude
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxx...     # ChatGPT/GPT-4
GEMINI_API_KEY=xxxx...        # Google's Gemini
XAI_API_KEY=xxxx...           # Grok
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=xxxx...      # DeepSeek
LLAMA_API_KEY=xxxx...         # Llama

# Optional configurations
LOG_LEVEL=info
ENABLE_TELEMETRY=false
```

"I've configured the necessary API keys for five different providers. In a production environment, you might want to use a secrets manager instead of environment variables, especially for sensitive credentials like these."

"Now let's start the server in development mode:"

```bash
npm run dev
```

*[Expected output]:*
```

"Great! Our server is now running with all AI provider connections successfully initialized. Let's open the web interface in our browser."

*[Switch to browser showing http://localhost:3001]*

## Running a Creative Brainstorm Session (5:00 - 15:00)

### Interface Overview (5:00 - 7:00)

*[Show the web interface]*

"This is the AI Collaboration Hub interface. On the left side, we have our AI model selection panel, where we can choose which models will participate in our collaboration. The central area is where we'll enter our prompt and view the results. On the right, we'll see the real-time collaboration process."

"For today's demonstration, I'll select Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, and DeepSeek to collaborate. This gives us a diverse set of models from different providers."

*[Click checkboxes for these four models]*

### Collaboration Mode Selection (7:00 - 9:00)

"Now, let's look at the collaboration modes. The AI Collaboration Hub supports five distinct collaboration patterns, each optimized for different types of tasks."

*[Click on Collaboration Settings]*

"For this demo, we'll use the 'Creative Brainstorm Swarm' mode, which is specifically designed to generate novel ideas and innovative solutions. This mode works in three phases:

1. First, each AI model independently generates several novel concepts
2. Then, they combine different ideas into more complex 'mega-ideas'
3. Finally, they vote on the best mega-idea and collaboratively develop it

Let's also set the collaboration style to 'Contrasting' to encourage diverse viewpoints."

*[Select "Creative Brainstorm Swarm" mode and "Contrasting" style]*

### Entering the Prompt (9:00 - 10:00)

"Now, let's enter our prompt. We'll ask the AI collaboration to generate innovative ideas for reducing urban traffic congestion that incorporate technology, urban planning, and behavior change incentives."

*[Type in the prompt box]:*
```
Generate innovative solutions for reducing urban traffic congestion.
Your solutions should integrate:
1. Modern technology applications
2. Urban planning principles
3. Behavioral economics incentives

For each solution, explain how it would work, potential challenges to implementation, and metrics to measure success.
```

"I'll set a budget cap of $1.00 to demonstrate the cost control feature. In a production environment, you might set higher limits based on your organization's needs."

*[Set budget cap to $1.00]*

### Executing the Collaboration (10:00 - 15:00)

"Now, let's submit this prompt and watch the AI models collaborate in real-time."

*[Click the Submit button]*

*[Show the collaboration process in real-time, with thinking indicators and streaming thoughts from each model. Narrate what's happening at each phase.]*

"As you can see, all four models are now working on the initial ideation phase. Claude is already generating ideas about smart traffic signals, while Gemini is exploring congestion pricing schemes. ChatGPT seems to be focusing on flexible work arrangements, and DeepSeek is considering multi-modal transit systems."

*[After a minute or so, phase transitions to idea fusion]*

"Now we've entered the idea fusion phase, where the models combine their initial concepts into more complex solutions. Notice how Claude is merging smart traffic signals with behavioral incentives, creating a comprehensive system that not only optimizes traffic flow but encourages specific behaviors through gamification."

*[After another minute, show voting phase]*

"In this final voting phase, each model is evaluating the merged ideas and selecting what they consider most promising. It looks like there's strong support for an integrated solution combining real-time transit data, adaptive traffic management, and personalized incentives."

*[Final collaborative answer appears]*

"And here's our final result! The collaboration has produced a comprehensive solution that integrates technology, urban planning, and behavioral economics in ways that might not have emerged from a single model."

## Inspecting Agent Scratchpads (15:00 - 20:00)

### Viewing Individual Contributions (15:00 - 17:00)

"One of the powerful features of the AI Collaboration Hub is the ability to inspect the 'scratchpad' of each participating agent. This lets us see their thought process, including ideas that might not have made it into the final solution."

*[Click on "View Agent Scratchpads" button]*

"Let's look at Claude's scratchpad first."

*[Click on Claude's avatar]*

*[Show Claude's detailed thought process, including its initial ideas, its reasoning when combining ideas, and its voting rationale]*

"Now let's look at Gemini's contributions."

*[Click on Gemini's avatar and show its scratchpad, highlighting differences in approach]*

### Comparing Approaches (17:00 - 20:00)

"It's fascinating to see the different approaches and perspectives each model brings. For example, notice how Claude focused heavily on user experience and privacy considerations, while Gemini emphasized technical feasibility and implementation pathways."

*[Cycle through the other models' scratchpads]*

"ChatGPT seemed to draw more from existing case studies and research, while DeepSeek took a more first-principles approach to problem-solving."

"This diversity of thought processes is exactly what makes the collaboration powerful - it combines the strengths and unique perspectives of each model."

*[Return to the final solution]*

"Looking at the final collaborative solution, we can see elements from each model's thinking integrated into a cohesive whole. The platform doesn't just pick a 'winning' response; it facilitates the creation of something new that incorporates the best insights from all participants."

## Cost and Performance Analysis (20:00 - 25:00)

### Viewing Cost Report (20:00 - 22:00)

"Let's examine the resource usage and cost breakdown for this collaboration session."
