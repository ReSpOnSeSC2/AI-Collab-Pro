Product Requirements Document: Collab Update
Problem Statement
The current collaboration module allows multiple LLMs to work together on user prompts, but it lacks the flexibility and nuanced interaction modes required for complex cognitive tasks. Users have expressed a need for more diverse collaboration patterns that can leverage the strengths of different LLMs working together in structured ways. Additionally, the current system doesn't effectively balance cost efficiency with sophisticated multi-agent collaboration or provide sufficient guardrails for quality control in collaborative outputs.

Goals
Enhance the collaboration module to support up to six LLMs working together on a single user prompt
Implement five new collaboration modes with distinct interaction patterns:
Round Table
Sequential Critique Chain
Validated Consensus
Creative Brainstorm Swarm
Hybrid Guarded Braintrust
Improve the quality and reliability of collaborative outputs through structured interaction modes
Maintain reasonable inference costs despite the increased number of LLMs involved
Provide clear value differentiation between collaboration modes to guide user selection
Success Metrics
Metric	Target	Measurement Method
User adoption of new modes	40% of collaboration sessions use new modes within 3 months	Usage analytics
Output quality improvement	25% increase in user satisfaction ratings	User feedback surveys
Cost efficiency	Average cost per collaborative session increases by no more than 35%	Cost tracking
Resolution rate	85% of collaborative sessions reach definitive outcomes	Session completion analytics
User engagement	30% increase in time spent using collaboration features	Usage analytics
Error rate	<2% of sessions fail due to technical issues	Error logging
Non-Goals
Implementing real-time collaborative editing between human users
Building a full-fledged project management system around the collaboration module
Supporting more than six LLMs in a single collaborative session
Adding specialized domain knowledge to the LLMs beyond their existing capabilities
Implementing user-defined custom collaboration workflows in this release
Creating persistent "personalities" for LLMs across sessions
Detailed Requirements
Collaboration Requirements
Round Table Mode
All participating LLMs receive the original prompt simultaneously
Each LLM provides an initial response
All responses are shared with all participants
A structured discussion follows where each LLM can comment on and integrate others' ideas
Final synthesis phase where one designated LLM creates consensus output
Sequential Critique Chain Mode
First LLM generates initial response to prompt
Each subsequent LLM receives all prior content and provides specific critiques
Each LLM must propose concrete improvements based on critiques
Chain continues until all LLMs have contributed
Final LLM integrates all feedback into revised, improved output
Validated Consensus Mode
All LLMs generate independent solutions
System identifies areas of agreement and disagreement
LLMs debate points of disagreement with required evidence/reasoning
Voting mechanism for unresolved disagreements
Final output includes confidence scores for different components
Explicit documentation of any unresolved points
Creative Brainstorm Swarm Mode
Parallel generation of ideas from all LLMs
Cross-pollination phase where LLMs build on others' ideas
Divergent thinking encouraged through specific prompting techniques
Clustering of similar ideas by semantic similarity
Evaluation phase to identify most promising directions
Synthesis of top ideas into cohesive output
Hybrid Guarded Braintrust Mode
Assigns different roles to LLMs: explorer, critic, synthesizer, etc.
Includes at least one "guardian" LLM specifically tasked with identifying risks/issues
Multiple structured rounds with defined handoffs between roles
Explicit stopping criteria based on quality thresholds
Metadata tagging of contributions by role
Final output includes confidence assessment and risk analysis
Security Requirements
All collaboration sessions must maintain the same data privacy standards as single-LLM interactions
Clear audit logging of which LLM contributed which portions to final outputs
Collaboration modes must be resistant to prompt injection attacks across LLMs
Session isolation to prevent cross-contamination between unrelated collaboration sessions
Rate limiting to prevent abuse of multi-LLM capabilities
Automatic content filtering across all LLM outputs with cascading permissions model
Cost Control Requirements
Implement dynamic scaling of LLM participation based on prompt complexity
Provide cost estimates before initiating multi-LLM sessions
Option to set maximum token budgets for collaborative sessions
Intelligent caching of intermediate results to avoid redundant computation
Graceful degradation to fewer LLMs if cost thresholds are approached
Analytics dashboard for monitoring collaboration costs by mode and scenario
User Experience Requirements
Clear, jargon-free descriptions of each collaboration mode with example use cases
Visual representation of collaboration process showing which LLM is contributing what
Ability to save preferred collaboration configurations for future use
Intuitive method for users to intervene/redirect during collaboration process
Progress indicators during multi-step collaboration processes
Simple export options for collaboration outputs and intermediate work
Stretch Requirements
Ability to assign specific LLMs to particular roles based on their strengths
User feedback integration during collaborative processes
Visualization of disagreement/agreement between LLMs
Confidence scoring for different parts of collaborative outputs
Multi-modal collaboration incorporating text and image understanding
"Replay" feature to review the collaboration process step by step

Open Questions
How should we handle significant disagreements between LLMs that don't reach resolution?
What is the optimal interface for users to select which specific LLMs participate in each collaboration mode?
Should users be able to save the intermediate steps and divergent paths from collaborative sessions?
How do we balance transparency of the collaboration process with overwhelming users with too much information?
What fallback strategies should we implement if one LLM in the collaboration chain fails?
How should we price these more complex collaboration features compared to single-LLM interactions?
What metrics best capture the quality improvements from these collaboration modes?
How do we effectively communicate the appropriate use cases for each collaboration mode?
