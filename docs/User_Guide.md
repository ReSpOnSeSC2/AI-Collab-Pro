3. **Submit**
   - Click the "Submit" button or press Enter
   - The system will process your prompt using the selected models

4. **View Results**
   - Individual model responses will appear in the Response Panel
   - Toggle between models to compare different answers

### Advanced Collaboration

1. **Select Collaboration Mode**
   - Click the "Collaboration Settings" button above the prompt input
   - Choose from available modes:
     - Round Table (Default)
     - Sequential Critique Chain

## Collaboration Modes in Detail

### Round Table

Best for general questions requiring balanced perspectives.

**How it works:**
- All models answer independently
- Models critique each other's responses
- Models vote on the best insights
- A final synthesis combines the best elements

**When to use:**
- For balanced, comprehensive answers to general knowledge questions
- When you want to see diverse perspectives on a topic
- For questions without a single "right" answer

### Sequential Critique Chain

Best for iterative refinement of content or ideas.

**How it works:**
- First model creates an initial answer
- Each subsequent model critiques and improves the previous response
- The chain continues until all models have contributed
- Final result represents progressively refined content

**When to use:**
- For technical writing that benefits from multiple reviews
- When accuracy and precision are important
- To leverage the unique strengths of different models sequentially

### Validated Consensus

Best for factual questions where accuracy is critical.

**How it works:**
- Two models co-draft an initial answer
- Other models verify facts and flag potential issues
- Drafting models revise based on feedback
- Final answer includes confidence indicators for claims

**When to use:**
- For research questions requiring high accuracy
- When factual correctness is paramount
- To minimize hallucinations or incorrect information

### Creative Brainstorm Swarm

Best for generating novel ideas and creative solutions.

**How it works:**
- Models independently generate creative ideas
- Models combine different ideas into novel hybrid concepts
- Models vote on the most promising ideas
- The winning idea is collectively developed

**When to use:**
- For brainstorming and ideation
- When seeking innovative solutions
- For creative writing and storytelling

### Hybrid Guarded Braintrust

Best for practical innovation requiring both creativity and accuracy.

**How it works:**
- Initial creative brainstorming phase
- Rigorous validation of the most promising ideas
- Development of validated ideas with supporting evidence

**When to use:**
- For business strategy or product development
- When seeking innovative but practical solutions
- To balance creativity with feasibility

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Model Unavailability**
- If a model appears greyed out, hover to see the reason
- Common reasons include rate limiting, API key issues, or provider downtime
- Try selecting a different model from the same provider

**Slow Response Times**
- Complex collaboration modes may take longer to complete
- Set a longer timeout in Settings > Preferences > Advanced
- Consider reducing the number of participating models

**Collaboration Errors**
- If collaboration fails, check the error message in the notification
- Try a different collaboration mode or a simpler prompt
- Ensure all selected models are currently available

### Getting Help

**In-App Help**
- Click the "?" icon in the top-right corner
- Browse the FAQ section for common questions
- Use the search function to find specific topics

**Support Contact**
- Email: support@ai-collab-hub.com

## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Prompts

For optimal collaboration results:

1. **Be Specific**
   - Clearly state what you're looking for
   - Include relevant context and background information

2. **Structure Your Prompts**
   - Break complex questions into parts
   - Use bullet points for multiple requirements

3. **Match Mode to Purpose**
   - Use Round Table for general questions
   - Use Validated Consensus for factual research
   - Use Creative Brainstorm for ideation

### Optimizing for Different Use Cases

- Include specific citation requirements in your prompt
- Ask for supporting arguments and counterarguments

**Creative Writing**
- Use Creative Brainstorm Swarm
- Specify the genre, tone, and length
- Provide character descriptions or plot elements

**Technical Explanations**
- Use Sequential Critique Chain
- Specify your technical background level
- Ask for analogies or visual explanations if helpful
