# AI-Collab Quick Start Guide

Welcome to AI-Collab! This guide will help you get started safely and securely.

## üöÄ Getting Started in 5 Minutes

### Option 1: Try Without API Keys (Demo Mode)

1. **Visit the live demo**: [https://ai-collab.vercel.app](https://ai-collab.vercel.app)
2. **Create a free account**
3. **Use platform-provided API keys** (limited usage)
4. **Test the collaboration features**

### Option 2: Use Your Own API Keys (Recommended)

1. **Create an account**
2. **Navigate to Settings ‚Üí API Keys**
3. **Test your keys first** (without saving)
4. **Add your API keys** (they're encrypted before storage)

## üîê Security First Approach

### Test Mode
Try our **Test Mode** to use your API keys without saving them:
1. Enter your API key
2. Click "Test Without Saving"
3. Run a test collaboration
4. Keys are never stored!

### Local Storage Mode
Keep your keys 100% local:
1. Enable "Local Storage Mode" in settings
2. API keys never leave your browser
3. Keys persist only in your browser

### Our Security Measures
- **AES-256-GCM encryption** for all stored keys
- **Zero-knowledge architecture** - we can't decrypt your keys
- **Open source** - verify our security yourself
- **Regular security audits**

## üìä Understanding the Interface

### Main Features

1. **Hub** - Your collaboration workspace
   - Select AI models
   - Choose collaboration style
   - Enter prompts
   - View results

2. **Model Comparison** - Compare AI models side-by-side
   - Performance metrics
   - Cost analysis
   - Quality scores

3. **Settings** - Manage your preferences
   - API keys
   - Default models
   - Cost alerts

4. **Security** - Learn about our security
   - Encryption demo
   - Security practices
   - FAQ

## üéØ Your First Collaboration

1. **Select Models**
   - Start with 2-3 models
   - Mix different providers (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini)

2. **Choose Collaboration Style**
   - **Parallel**: All models work simultaneously
   - **Sequential**: Models build on each other
   - **Voting**: Models vote on best response
   - **Critique**: Models review each other

3. **Enter Your Prompt**
   ```
   Example: "Write a Python function to calculate fibonacci numbers 
   with both recursive and iterative approaches, then explain the 
   time complexity of each."
   ```

4. **Review Results**
   - See individual model responses
   - View consensus/final output
   - Check quality scores
   - Monitor costs

## üí° Tips for Success

### API Key Management
- **Get free API keys**:
  - [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) - $5 free credit
  - [Anthropic Claude](https://console.anthropic.com/) - Free tier available
  - [Google Gemini](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) - Free tier
  - [DeepSeek](https://platform.deepseek.com/) - Affordable pricing

### Cost Optimization
- Set **cost alerts** in settings
- Use **smaller models** for simple tasks
- Enable **response caching**
- Monitor usage in dashboard

### Best Practices
1. **Start small** - Test with short prompts
2. **Compare styles** - Find what works best
3. **Mix models** - Different models excel at different tasks
4. **Review metrics** - Learn from quality scores
